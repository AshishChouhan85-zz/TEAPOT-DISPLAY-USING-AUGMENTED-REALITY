# TEAPOT-DISPLAY-USING-AUGMENTED-REALITY
This project is based on the theme of E-YANTRA 2018 Thirsty Crow Event.
The project uses opencv and opengl to render a virtual teapot on aruco markers.
Although 4 textures were used to wrap around the teapot, i have used only two textures as code for the other two will be same.

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
The project uses the combination of opencv and opengl to render a textured teapot on aruco markers.
Two windows are displayed on running the project.
The opencv window creates border around the detected marker and also displays its id.
The opengl window uses rotation vector and translation vector obtained from opencv functions.
A view matrix was made using an algorithm based on basic trigonometry.
